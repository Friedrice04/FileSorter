# FileSorter

**FileSorter** is a user-friendly desktop application for sorting files into folders based on customizable mapping rules. It features a graphical interface for editing mapping files, managing template folder structures, and running file sorting operations with optional deep audit.

---

## Features

- **Mapping Editor:**  
  Create, edit, and search mapping files (`.json`) that define how files are sorted by pattern (wildcards supported).
- **Template Directory Structure:**  
  Visualize, add, delete, and rename folders in your template directory.  
  Drag-and-drop folders from Windows Explorer to add their structure (folders only, no files).
- **Pattern-to-Folder Assignment:**  
  Assign file patterns to destination folders using a table. Drag patterns onto folders in the tree to set destinations.
- **Auto-Build Template Tree:**  
  Automatically create the template folder structure based on all destinations in your mapping.
- **Mapping Import:**  
  Create a new mapping by importing from an existing mapping file, with clear indication of the selected import file.
- **Persistent Last Mapping:**  
  The last used mapping is remembered and auto-selected on next launch.
- **File Sorting:**  
  Select one or more folders to sort. Drag-and-drop folders into the app or use the "Add Folder" button.
- **Deep Audit:**  
  Optionally, after sorting, recursively move misplaced files to their correct folders.
- **Help and Tooltips:**  
  Built-in help and tooltips for all major controls.

## Notes

- **Mappings:**  
  Mapping files are JSON objects:  
  ```json
  {
    "*.pdf": "PDF Documents",
    "Invoice*2024*.docx": "2024 Invoices"
  }
  ```
- **Template Folders:**  
  Each mapping file has a corresponding `_template` folder for its folder structure.
- **Drag-and-Drop:**  
  Drag folders from Explorer to the template tree to add their structure (folders only, no files).

---

## Troubleshooting

- If drag-and-drop does not work, ensure `tkinterdnd2` is installed.
- If you see errors about missing mappings or folders, ensure you have created at least one mapping and template directory.
